This avoids traffic and provides direct routes.  I know the city would love to connect downtown with oakland without adding to the traffic congestion.  What better solution than an aerial gondola.  I have been to several ski towns that use gondolas to move people around town not just up the mountain.   Also less frequent stops for buses, people should be able to walk 1/4 of a mile to a transit stop.   I visit New York frequently and walking several blocks is the norm. I have taken a bus that stops 3 times in a block.  Way to slow.",FOREST HILLS,Forest Hills Borough,Turtle Creek Valley,26592,828,36708

Monroeville used to have a Gold Bus specifically to transport people to grocery stores, malls, and hospitals in the area.  I am a supporter of public transportation but it is very inconvenient in the East Suburbs.  I have to drive to a bus stop (Monroeville Mall or Penn Center) and because I am going to Oakland don\t have the option of a flyer bus.  Therefore I leave my house at 8 AM to arrive at Pitt in time for 10 AM classes.  Wait times back to Monroeville for the 67 or 69 routes are typically 45 minutes or more (they appear to run only once per hour).

Im fortunate enough to have a car that I can use to get to those places with ease, and I actually prefer to drive in most cases, but I know that others are not so fortunate.\n\nThe area that I strongly believe needs a connection to the P67 line is the Churchill Valley area of Penn Hills. I have known several people who walk along unsafe, unpaved sides of roads along Rodi Road for 30 minutes to get to the P67 stop at William Penn Highway and Rodi Road. I also go to the Penn Hills shopping center once a week to run errands. I believe Rodi Road had a bus route on that strip in the past, but no longer does, and it would be great to see it come back.\n\nThank you also for your beautifully designed website, infographics, and interactive maps!

Even when they are, my next reason would be cost and finally that I cant rely on the buses to get there in a timely fashion. When I was a student at Pitt, I took the bus nearly every day between home (same place I live now) and Oakland. The stops were rather convenient and I had several route options (3) with varying walk times that were acceptable. The only way I was able to afford that was because of the free fare through Pitt. \n\nOn another note, Pittsburgh is one of the ONLY metropolitan areas I have been to in the world that does not have reliable and easy-to-use transit to the airport. While I believe that it is important to develop and support routes for people who are unable to afford NOT to take the bus to school and work (it is a luxury to be able to own my own car and pay for a ride share if necessary), having reliable transportation to the airport would do a lot for Pittsburgh as a city and the region as a whole.
